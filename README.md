# Fitness Tracker JSON

The purpose of the project is to centrally locate the exercises, records, and routines for the Fitness Tracker App. This is likely a temporaty solution until a persistent database solution is made.

The data will be stored in the fitness-data.json file. This file can be generated using the build NPM script from the project.

```
npm run build
```

### Accessing the Data
